            <br>
            <p>I arrived in the United States in January 2018 and spent my first eight months in the suburb of Chicago. I took care of 4 years old twins. My schedule was 45 hours a week, monday to friday, from 8am to 5pm. I had a good time with them, although their Mom had a difficult personally, and due to that I decided to change to a new family.</p>
        
            <p>Because of that decision, I ended up in the Seattle area, which was the best thing that happened to me, because it was what brought me to live and be where I am today.</p>

            <p>The second family was very good, my schedule was 30 hours a week, with a break of 6 hours in the afternoon while the boys were at school. I was treated very well by the whole family, including grandparents. I lived one year and 4 months with the second family in Mercer Island, I took care of two boys, 12 and 15 years old. My main job was to drive them to school, football, doctor, help with the homework, and make dinner for the boys.</p></div>
