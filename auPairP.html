            <br>
            <p>The au pair program is for people between the ages of 18 and 26 to live in the USA on a J-1 visitor visa.</p>
        <p>
            A cultural and paid exchange in which the participant will have the opportunity to live in another country for a period of 1 year, which may extend to a maximum of 2 years. This exchange involves work with children and studies. The Au Pair will live in the home of a host family, and as an exchange will look after the children of that family.</p>
            
        <p>The routine of an Au Pair is: work 45 hours a week, but never more than 10 hours a day. The job itself is to do everything related to the children's daily lives, such as: taking care of the children and their belongings, playing with them, taking them for a walk, preparing the school snack, bathing, organizing the toys.</p>
        <p> The exchange student is entitled to private accommodation, health insurance, daily meals, a weekly break and at least 1 full weekend off per month, a weekly salary of U$195.75, a scholarship paid by the family of U$500.00 and two weeks paid vacation.</p>
